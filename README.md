Just playing around with GitHub code repository

This was a lecture in an online course I did through Udemy. The course was "The Complete iOS 11 & Swift Developer Course - Build 20 Apps". 
The intent of the course was to demostrate version control so the Xcode project details saved here are nothing spectacular.
